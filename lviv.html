        ## Take home messages

        - Fairness is _Domain Specific_.
        - If you don't think about bias, it will come back to haunt you.
        - Accuracy only tells part of the story.
        - Fairness is an active and exciting research topic.

        ## Classification

        - given some input $X$, predict a class label $Y \in \\{0, 1, ..., C-1\\}$
        - $X$ is usually a **vector**
            - often with high number of dimensions, e.g. more than 1 million for a picture
        - simplest case: **binary classification**, $Y \in \\{0, 1\\}$
            - for example: is there a hot dog in this picture ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)?

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Classification

        - we are looking to train a function $f$ that maps $X$ to $Y$
        - the output is the prediction: $\hat{Y} = f(X)$
        - we want $\hat{Y}$ to be as close as possible to the label $Y$
        - $f$ can be implemented as
            - a neural network
            - an SVM
            - a decision-tree model

        ## Training data

        - training data: a set of pairs $(x, y)$
            - input data $x$ with corresponding label $y$
        - we are looking for model that works well on _unseen data_
        - so we try to gather training data that is _similar_ to deployment setting
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Training data

        - BUT this is not always possible
        - if we make predictions on data that is *very different* from the training data,
          the model will perform badly
        - problem if the training data does not describe reality well

        ## Sampling bias &#10132; tyranny of the majority

        - In the <span class="highlight">imSitu</span> situation recognition <span class="highlight">dataset</span>, the activity cooking is over 33\% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained algorithm further <span class="highlight">amplifies</span> the disparity to 68\%

        ## Sampling bias &#10132; tyranny of the majority

        - <span class="highlight">The reason is</span>: the algorithm predicts the gender from the activity and not from looking at the person

    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Desired result

        - what we would want is that the algorithm only looks at the person when predicting the gender
        - if the gender is not recognizable from the picture, the algorithm should be "unsure"
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Biased data

        - in the previous example, certain training examples were underrepresented
            - sampling bias
        - other case: data is simply wrong
            - e.g. data was gathered by humans who just lied
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Enforcing a fair outcome

        - no matter in what way the data is biased: we want to **enforce a fair outcome**
            - idea: just tell the algorithm that it should treat all groups in the same way
        - question: **how do we define a fair outcome?**
            - really hard question
            - start with the simplest definition
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Example

        - task: predict whether someone should be hired ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)
        - two races: <span style="color: blue">blue race</span> and <span style="color: green">green race</span>
            - blue: $S=0$, green: $S=1$
        - in the training set: **20% of blue** applicants were hired, **80% of green** applicants were hired
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Statistical parity

        $$
        P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1)
        $$

        - $\hat{Y} \in \\{0,1\\}, S \in \\{0,1\\}$
        - $S$: sensitive attribute (for example gender, race)
        - $\hat{Y}$: prediction

        **meaning**: the probability to get a positive prediction is the same for each group
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Statistical parity

        - concrete: when evaluating the algorithm on the test set, both groups ($S=0$ and $S=1$)
          should have the same number of positive predictions ($\hat{Y}=1$)
        - in the hiring example from before: same percentage from both races will be hired (e.g. 50%)
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Side effects of statistical parity

        - enforcing statistical parity necessarily produces **lower accuracy**
        - consider this: we want to enforce 50% acceptance for the blue race but the training data only has 20% accepted
            - some individuals of the blue race have to be "misclassified"
              ($\hat{Y} = 1$ instead of $\hat{Y} = 0$)
              to make the numbers work
        - not surprising because we are computing accuracy against the *biased data*
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Trade-off: Fairness &ndash; Accuracy

        - usually we don't want to have too bad accuracy with respect to the data
        - goal: find algorithm that produces fair result at highest possible accuracy
        - otherwise it's easy: a *random classifier* is very fair (but useless)
            - random classifier: just predict $\hat{Y} = 1$ 50% of the time regardless of input
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Summary of Statistical Parity

        - very simple criterion
        - introduces Fairness &ndash; Accuracy trade-off
        - more sophisticated criteria are possible (based on causal graphs)

        <h1>Bias introduced by the ML algorithm</h1>
    </section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Why would an ML algorithm introduce bias?

        Consider again the hiring example:
        - two features: SAT score and race (blue and green) of individuals
        - task: predict if they should be hired ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)
        - composition of the dataset: 50% blue, 50% green. 20% of blue have $Y=1$, 80% of green have $Y=1$.
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        The dataset is heavily skewed but let's ignore that for now and just try to make accurate predictions for this dataset.
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        (Reminder: 20% of blue have $Y=1$, 80% of green have $Y=1$.)

        A simple way to make relatively accurate predictions:
        - ignore the SAT score
        - for green individuals always predict $Y=1$
<!--        base the prediction on SAT-->
        - for blue individuals always predict $Y=0$

        Result: up to 80% accuracy (80% in blue subgroup and 80% in green subgroup)
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        - the dataset was already skewed but the algorithm's prediction are even more "unfair"
        - this is because it's easier to just base the decision on race than to figure out the effect of the SAT
        - this is an extreme case but similar things can actually happen
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        **What we do not want:** the algorithm "being lazy" in a subgroup

        **What we want:** the algorithm should make equally good predictions for all subgroups

        Criterion that enforces this: *Equality of Opportunity*
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Equality of Opportunity

        $$
        P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0, Y=1) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1, Y=1)
        $$

        - with $Y, \hat{Y} \in \\{0,1\\}$ and $S \in \\{0,1\\}$

        **meaning**: the probability of predicting 1, given that the label is 1, should be the same for all groups

        **in practice**: the TPR (true positive rate) should be the same in all groups
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Equalised Odds

        $$
        P(\hat{Y}=y | S=0, Y=y) = P(\hat{Y}=y | S=1, Y=y)
        $$

        for all possible values for $y$

        - stricter version of *Equality of Opportunity*
        - TPR and TNR (true negative rate) must be the same in all groups
            - TPR = TP / (TP + FN), TNR = TN / (TN + FP)
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Properties

        - **EoO** (Equality of Opportunity) and **EO** (Equalised Odds) both assume that the training data is correct
        - a perfect classifier (that always predicts the correct label) fulfills **EoO** and **EO**d
        - however: a random classifier does as well
            - a random classifier achieves 50% TPR (and TNR) in all groups
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Accuracy&ndash;Fairness trade-off

        - achieving EoO or EO at low accuracy is easy (see random classifier)
        - here, even more than for Statistical Parity, it is important to find an algorithm with good fairness and good accuracy
    </textarea></section>

        <span class="citeme">Article 21, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</span>
        - From the legal context to algorithmic fairness, e.g.:

      <h2>Fairness based on similarity</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>First define a distance metric on your datapoints (i.e. how similar are the datapoints)
        <ul>
          <li>Can be just Euclidean distance but is usually something else (because of different scales)</li>
          <li>This is the hardest step and requires domain knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pre-processing based on similarity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>An individual is then considered to be unfairly treated if it is treated differently than its "neighbours".</li>
        <li>For any data point we can check how many of the $k$ nearest neighbours have the same class label as that data point</li>
        <li>If the percentage is under a certain threshold then there was discrimination against the individual corresponding to that data point.</li>
        <li>Then: flip the class labels of those data points where the class label is considered unfair</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Considering similarity during training</h2>
      <p>Alternative idea:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a classifier is fair if and only if the predictive distributions for any two data points are at least as similar
          as the two points themselves
          <ul>
           <li>(according to a given similarity measure for distributions and a given similarity measure for data points)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Considering similarity during training</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Needed similarity measure for distributions</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Which fairness criteria should we use?</h2>
        <p>We've seen several statistical definitions and Individual Fairness</p>
        <p>
            There's no right answer, all of the previous examples are "fair".
            It's important to consult <span class="highlight">domain experts</span> to find which is the best fit for each problem.

        <h2>Delayed Impact of Fair Learning</h2>
        <p>In the real world there are implications.</p>
        <p>An individual doesn't just cease to exist after we've made our loan or bail decision.</p>

        ## Delayed Impact of Fair Learning

        Consider a bank's lending decision.

        The outcome is not simply reject or accept the applicant for a loan. In fact, there are multiple effects of this decision.

        If the applicant receives a loan, then goes on to successfully pay it back, then not only will the bank make a profit, but then the applicant's credit score will increase.

        This will make future loan decisions more favorable to the applicant.

        ## Delayed Impact of Fair Learning

        We could think of this in terms of loss functions.

        The banks objective was to maximize profit. After deciding to give the loan, the loan was repaid (with interest). The bank made money.

        To maximize the objective (minimize the negative of the loss) the bank wants to give out as many loans that are likely to be repaid as possible.

        ## Delayed Impact of Fair Learning

        In this scenario we have a slightly different concern. We don't want loans to be given to one subgroup (such as blue race), more often than members of another subgroup (green race).

        Our concern is that if the number of people who receive loans from one group outweigh the other, then as a whole, the credit rating will become a euphemism for race.

        ## Fair Representations

        Popular approach is to add produce a "fair" representation. Consider that we have 2 roles, a data vendor, who is charge of collecting the data and preparing it. Our other role is a data user, someone who will be making predictions based on our data.

        The data vendor is concerned that the data user may be using their data to make unfair decisions. So the data vendor decides to learn a new, fair representation.

        The state-of-the-art method a fair representation this is to use an *adversarial* network, using a "Gradient-Reversal Layer" from Ganin et al.

    <h2>Causality</h2>
    <p><b>Motivation</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Fairness metrics so far have only looked at <em>correlations</em> between the sensitive attribute and the prediction
      <li>But isn't a causal path more important?
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causality</h2>
    <p>Example:
    <p>Admissions at Berkeley college.
    <p>Men were found to be accepted with much higher probability. Was it discrimination?
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causality</h2>
    <p>Was it discrimination?
    <p>Not necessarily! The reason was that women were applying to more competitive departments.
    <p>Departments like medicine and law are very competitive (hard to get in).
    <p>Departments like computer science are much less competetive (because it's boring ;).
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>$R$: admission decision
      <li>$A$: gender
      <li>$X$: department choice

    <h2>Causality</h2>
    <!-- <p>"Correlation doesn't imply causation"</p> -->
    <!-- <p class="fragment">But what is causation?</p> -->
    <p>If we can understand what <b>causes</b> unfair behavior, then we can take steps to mitigate it.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Basic idea: a sensitive attribute may only affect the prediction via legitimate causal paths.</p>

    <h2>Causal Graphs</h2>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> build causal graphs of your problem</p>
    <p><b>Problem:</b> causality cannot be inferred from observational data</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observational data can only show correlations
      <li>For causal information we have to do <i>experiments</i>. (But that is often not ethical.)
      <li>Currently: just guess the causal structure
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Path-specific causal fairness</h2>
    <p>
    $A$ is a sensitive attribute, and its direct effect on $Y$ and effect through $M$ is considered unfair.
    But $L$ is considered admissible.

    <h2>Path-specific causal fairness</h2>
    <p>With a structural causal model (SCM), like this:
    <p><img src="images/scm.png" style="width: 50%">
    <p>You can figure out exactly how each feature should be incorporated in order to make a fair prediction.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Path-specific causal fairness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Advantage:</b> we can figure out <em>exactly</em> how to avoid unfairness
      <li><b>Problem:</b> requires an SCM, which we usually don't have and which is hard to get
      <li><b>Problem:</b> we have to decide for each feature individually whether it's admissible
        <ul>
          <li>This will not work for computer vision tasks where the raw features are pixels
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Counterfactual Fairness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>slightly different idea but also based on SCMs (structural causal model)
      <li>we're basically asking: in the counterfactual world where your gender was different, would you have been accepted?
        <ul>
          <li><em>counterfactual</em>: something that has not happened or is not the case
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Counterfactuals</h2>
    <p>Example of a counterfactual statement:
    <blockquote>If Oswald had not shot Kennedy, no-one else would have.</blockquote>
    <p>This is counterfactual, because Oswald did in fact shoot Kennedy.
    <p>It's a claim about a counterfactual world.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Counterfactual Fairness</h2>
    <p>$U$: set of all unobserved background variables</p>
    <p>$P(\hat{y}_{s=i}(U) = 1|x, s=i)=P(\hat{y}_{s=j}(U) = 1|x, s=i)$</p>
    <p>$i, j \in \{0, 1\}$</p>
    <p>$\hat{y}_{s=k}$: prediction in the counterfactual world where $s=k$</p>
    <p><b>practical consequence:</b> $\hat{y}$ is counterfactually fair if it does not causally depend
    (as defined by the causal model) on $s$ or any descendants of $s$.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The problem of getting the SCM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Causal models cannot be learned from observational data only
        <ul>
          <li>You can try, but there is no <em>unique</em> solution
        </ul>
      <li>Different causal models can lead to very different results
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Example with Causal Graphs</h2>
    <p><b>Example:</b> Law school success</p>
    <p>Task: given GPA score and LSAT (law school entry exam), predict grades after one year in law school:
      FYA (first year average)</p>
    <p>Additionally two sensitive attributes: <i>race</i> and <i>gender</i></p>

    <h2>Causality &mdash; Summary</h2>

      <li>However these models are difficult to obtain.
