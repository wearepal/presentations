        ## Take home messages

        - Fairness is _Domain Specific_.
        - If you don't think about bias, it will come back to haunt you.
        - Accuracy only tells part of the story.
        - Fairness is an active and exciting research topic.

        ## Classification

        - given some input $X$, predict a class label $Y \in \\{0, 1, ..., C-1\\}$
        - $X$ is usually a **vector**
            - often with high number of dimensions, e.g. more than 1 million for a picture
        - simplest case: **binary classification**, $Y \in \\{0, 1\\}$
            - for example: is there a hot dog in this picture ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)?

        ## Classification

        - we are looking to train a function $f$ that maps $X$ to $Y$
        - the output is the prediction: $\hat{Y} = f(X)$
        - we want $\hat{Y}$ to be as close as possible to the label $Y$
        - $f$ can be implemented as
            - a neural network
            - an SVM
            - a decision-tree model

        ## Training data

        - training data: a set of pairs $(x, y)$
            - input data $x$ with corresponding label $y$
        - we are looking for model that works well on _unseen data_
        - so we try to gather training data that is _similar_ to deployment setting

        ## Training data

        - BUT this is not always possible
        - if we make predictions on data that is *very different* from the training data,
          the model will perform badly
        - problem if the training data does not describe reality well

        ## Algorithmic bias

        (Broadly) The problem can be divided into <ins>two categories</ins>.

        Both types of bias can appear together.

        - bias stemming from biased training data
        - bias stemming from the algorithms themselves

        ## Bias in, bias out

        - Databases: GIGO

        ## Sampling bias &#10132; tyranny of the majority

        - In the <span class="highlight">imSitu</span> situation recognition <span class="highlight">dataset</span>, the activity cooking is over 33\% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained algorithm further <span class="highlight">amplifies</span> the disparity to 68\%

        ## Sampling bias &#10132; tyranny of the majority

        - <span class="highlight">The reason is</span>: the algorithm predicts the gender from the activity and not from looking at the person

    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Desired result

        - what we would want is that the algorithm only looks at the person when predicting the gender
        - if the gender is not recognizable from the picture, the algorithm should be "unsure"
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Biased data

        - in the previous example, certain training examples were underrepresented
            - sampling bias
        - other case: data is simply wrong
            - e.g. data was gathered by humans who just lied
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Enforcing a fair outcome

        - no matter in what way the data is biased: we want to **enforce a fair outcome**
            - idea: just tell the algorithm that it should treat all groups in the same way
        - question: **how do we define a fair outcome?**
            - really hard question
            - start with the simplest definition
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Example

        - task: predict whether someone should be hired ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)
        - two races: <span style="color: blue">blue race</span> and <span style="color: green">green race</span>
            - blue: $S=0$, green: $S=1$
        - in the training set: **20% of blue** applicants were hired, **80% of green** applicants were hired
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Statistical parity

        $$
        P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1)
        $$

        - $\hat{Y} \in \\{0,1\\}, S \in \\{0,1\\}$
        - $S$: sensitive attribute (for example gender, race)
        - $\hat{Y}$: prediction

        **meaning**: the probability to get a positive prediction is the same for each group
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Statistical parity

        - concrete: when evaluating the algorithm on the test set, both groups ($S=0$ and $S=1$)
          should have the same number of positive predictions ($\hat{Y}=1$)
        - in the hiring example from before: same percentage from both races will be hired (e.g. 50%)
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Side effects of statistical parity

        - enforcing statistical parity necessarily produces **lower accuracy**
        - consider this: we want to enforce 50% acceptance for the blue race but the training data only has 20% accepted
            - some individuals of the blue race have to be "misclassified"
              ($\hat{Y} = 1$ instead of $\hat{Y} = 0$)
              to make the numbers work
        - not surprising because we are computing accuracy against the *biased data*
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Trade-off: Fairness &ndash; Accuracy

        - usually we don't want to have too bad accuracy with respect to the data
        - goal: find algorithm that produces fair result at highest possible accuracy
        - otherwise it's easy: a *random classifier* is very fair (but useless)
            - random classifier: just predict $\hat{Y} = 1$ 50% of the time regardless of input
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Summary of Statistical Parity

        - very simple criterion
        - introduces Fairness &ndash; Accuracy trade-off
        - more sophisticated criteria are possible (based on causal graphs)
    </textarea></section>

                <h1>Bias introduced by the ML algorithm</h1>
            </section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Why would an ML algorithm introduce bias?

        Consider again the hiring example:
        - two features: SAT score and race (blue and green) of individuals
        - task: predict if they should be hired ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)
        - composition of the dataset: 50% blue, 50% green. 20% of blue have $Y=1$, 80% of green have $Y=1$.
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        The dataset is heavily skewed but let's ignore that for now and just try to make accurate predictions for this dataset.
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        (Reminder: 20% of blue have $Y=1$, 80% of green have $Y=1$.)

        A simple way to make relatively accurate predictions:
        - ignore the SAT score
        - for green individuals always predict $Y=1$
<!--        base the prediction on SAT-->
        - for blue individuals always predict $Y=0$

        Result: up to 80% accuracy (80% in blue subgroup and 80% in green subgroup)
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        - the dataset was already skewed but the algorithm's prediction are even more "unfair"
        - this is because it's easier to just base the decision on race than to figure out the effect of the SAT
        - this is an extreme case but similar things can actually happen
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Bias from algorithm

        **What we do not want:** the algorithm "being lazy" in a subgroup

        **What we want:** the algorithm should make equally good predictions for all subgroups

        Criterion that enforces this: *Equality of Opportunity*
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Equality of Opportunity

        $$
        P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0, Y=1) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1, Y=1)
        $$

        - with $Y, \hat{Y} \in \\{0,1\\}$ and $S \in \\{0,1\\}$

        **meaning**: the probability of predicting 1, given that the label is 1, should be the same for all groups

        **in practice**: the TPR (true positive rate) should be the same in all groups
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Equalised Odds

        $$
        P(\hat{Y}=y | S=0, Y=y) = P(\hat{Y}=y | S=1, Y=y)
        $$

        for all possible values for $y$

        - stricter version of *Equality of Opportunity*
        - TPR and TNR (true negative rate) must be the same in all groups
            - TPR = TP / (TP + FN), TNR = TN / (TN + FP)
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Properties

        - **EoO** (Equality of Opportunity) and **EO** (Equalised Odds) both assume that the training data is correct
        - a perfect classifier (that always predicts the correct label) fulfills **EoO** and **EO**
        - however: a random classifier does as well
            - a random classifier achieves 50% TPR (and TNR) in all groups
    </textarea></section>

            <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
        ## Accuracy&ndash;Fairness trade-off

        - achieving EoO or EO at low accuracy is easy (see random classifier)
        - here, even more than for Statistical Parity, it is important to find an algorithm with good fairness and good accuracy

        ## Delayed Impact of Fair Learning

        Consider a bank's lending decision.

        The outcome is not simply reject or accept the applicant for a loan. In fact, there are multiple effects of this decision.

        If the applicant receives a loan, then goes on to successfully pay it back, then not only will the bank make a profit, but then the applicant's credit score will increase.

        This will make future loan decisions more favorable to the applicant.

        ## Delayed Impact of Fair Learning

        We could think of this in terms of loss functions.

        The banks objective was to maximize profit. After deciding to give the loan, the loan was repaid (with interest). The bank made money.

        To maximize the objective (minimize the negative of the loss) the bank wants to give out as many loans that are likely to be repaid as possible.

        ## Delayed Impact of Fair Learning

        In this scenario we have a slightly different concern. We don't want loans to be given to one subgroup (such as blue race), more often than members of another subgroup (green race).

        Our concern is that if the number of people who receive loans from one group outweigh the other, then as a whole, the credit rating will become a euphemism for race.

        ## Fair Representations

        Popular approach is to add produce a "fair" representation. Consider that we have 2 roles, a data vendor, who is charge of collecting the data and preparing it. Our other role is a data user, someone who will be making predictions based on our data.

        The data vendor is concerned that the data user may be using their data to make unfair decisions. So the data vendor decides to learn a new, fair representation.

        The state-of-the-art method a fair representation this is to use an *adversarial* network, using a "Gradient-Reversal Layer" from Ganin et al.

                during training of the model.

        We use deep generative modelling:

            ## Interpretability with contrastive examples

            - All previous work with adversarial learning try to <span class="highlight">remove</span> sensitive attributes from data
            - Instead, we use adversarial learning to <span class="highlight">generate</span> data points with pre-specified sensitive attributes (contrastive examples)
            - Contrastive examples can be easily interpreted because they do have the semantic meaning of the input

                <h2>Fairness without constraints</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most fairness methods for "during training" are formulated as constraints
                    <li>This means either
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using very special models where constrained-based optimization is possible
                            <li>Using Lagrange multipliers
                        </ul>

                <h2>Lagrange multipliers</h2>
                <p>Constrained optimization problem:
                <p>$$\min\limits_\theta\, f(\theta) \quad\text{s.th.}~ g(\theta) = 0$$
                <p>This gets reformulated as
                <p>$f(\theta) + \lambda g(\theta)$
                <p>where $\lambda$ has to be determined, but is usually just set to some value
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Shortcomings of this</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The value of $\lambda$ has no real meaning and is usually just set to arbitrary values
                    <li>It's hard to tell whether the constraint is fulfilled
                </ul>

                <h2>Alternate approach</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduce <em>pseudo labels</em> $\bar{y}$.
                    <li>Make sure $\bar{y}$ is fair ($\bar{y}\perp s$).
                    <li>Use $\bar{y}$ as prediction target.
                </ul>
                <p>$$P(y=1|x,s,\theta)=\sum\limits_{\bar{y}\in\{0,1\}} P(y=1|\bar{y},s)P(\bar{y}|x,\theta)$$

            <section>
                <h2>Alternate approach</h2>
                <p>For demographic parity:
                <p>$P(\bar{y}|s=0)=P(\bar{y}|s=1)$
                <p>This allows us to compute $P(y=1|\bar{y},s)$. Which is all we need.

                <h2>Multinomial sensitive attribute</h2>
                <p>The usual metrics for Demographic Parity are only defined for binary attributes: it's either a
                    <em>ratio</em> or a <em>difference</em> of two probabilities.
                <p><b>Alternative</b>:
                <p>Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi Maximum Correlation Coefficient (HGR)
                <ul>
                    <li>defined on the domain [0,1]
                    <li>$HGR(Y,S) = 0$ iff $Y\perp S$
                    <li>$HGR(Y,S) = 1$ iff there is a deterministic function to map between them

                <h2>Causality</h2>
                <p><b>Motivation</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fairness methods so far have only looked at <em>correlations</em> between the sensitive
                        attribute and the prediction
                    <li>But isn't a causal path more important?

                <h2>Causality</h2>

                <h2>Causality</h2>
                <p>Was it discrimination?
                <p>Not necessarily! The reason was that women were applying to more competitive departments.
                <p>Departments like medicine and law are very competitive (hard to get in).
                <p>Departments like computer science are much less competetive (because it's boring ;).

                    But $L$ is considered admissible.
