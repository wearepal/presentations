## Machine Learning

> ...using statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn"
  (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task)
  from data, without being explicitly programmed.
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Classification

- given some input $X$, predict a class label $Y \in \\{0, 1, ..., C-1\\}$
- $X$ is usually a **vector**
  - often with high number of dimensions, e.g. more than 1 million for a picture
- simplest case: **binary classification**, $Y \in \\{0, 1\\}$
  - for example: is there a hot dog in this picture ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)?
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Classification

- we are looking to train a function $f$ that maps $X$ to $Y$
- the output is the prediction: $\hat{Y} = f(X)$
- we want $\hat{Y}$ to be as close as possible to the label $Y$
- $f$ can be implemented as
  - a neural network
  - an SVM
  - a logistic regression model
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Training data

- training data: a set of pairs $(x, y)$
  - input data $x$ with corresponding label $y$
- we are looking for model that works well on the training data
- if we make predictions on data that is *very different* from the training data,
  the model will perform badly
- problem if the training data does not describe reality well
</textarea></section>

## Where is machine learning used?

- hiring decisions
- bail decisions
- credit approval
- insurance premiums

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Algorithmic bias

- machine learning systems are making decisions that affect humans
- these decisions should be *fair*
- by default machine learning algorithms tend to be biased in some way
  - why?
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Algorithmic bias

The problem can be divided into <ins>two categories</ins>. Both types of bias can appear together.

- bias stemming from biased training data
- bias stemming from the algorithms themselves
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
# Biased training data
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Bias in, bias out

- Databases: GIGO
- ML: BIBO
  - the ML algorithm just learns what is in the training data
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Examples for bias

**Task**: generate description for images

![](./images/women_also_snowboard/example1.png)
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Learning wrong features

The algorithm predicts the gender from the activity and not from looking at the person.

![](./images/women_also_snowboard/example2.png)
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Desired result

- what we would want is that the algorithm only looks at the person when predicting the gender
- if the gender is not recognizable from the picture, the algorithm should be "unsure"
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Biased data

- in the previous example, certain training examples were underrepresented
  - sampling bias
- other case: data is simply wrong
  - e.g. data was gathered by humans who just lied
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Enforcing a fair outcome

- no matter in what way the data is biased: we want to **enforce a fair outcome**
  - idea: just tell the algorithm that it should treat all groups in the same way
- question: **how do we define a fair outcome?**
  - really hard question
  - start with the simplest definition
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Example

- task: predict whether someone should be hired ($Y=1$) or not ($Y=0$)
- two races: <span style="color: blue">blue race</span> and <span style="color: green">green race</span>
  - blue: $S=0$, green: $S=1$
- in the training set: **20% of blue** applicants were hired, **50% of green** applicants were hired
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Statistical parity

$$
P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1)
$$

- $\hat{Y} \in \\{0,1\\}, S \in \\{0,1\\}$
- $S$: sensitive attribute (for example gender, race)
- $\hat{Y}$: prediction

**meaning**: the probability to get a positive prediction is the same for each group
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Statistical parity

- concrete: when evaluating the algorithm on the test set, both groups ($S=0$ and $S=1$)
  should have the same number of positive predictions ($\hat{Y}=1$)
- in the hiring example from before: same percentage from both races will be hired (e.g. 30%)
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
# Bias introduced by the ML algorithm
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Why would an ML algorithm introduce bias?

Consider again the hiring example:

- two features: SAT score and race (blue and green) of individuals

- task: predict if they should be hired ($y=1$) or not ($y=0$)

- composition of the dataset: 50% blue, 50% green. 20% of blue have $y=1$, 50% of green have $y=1$.
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Bias from algorithm

The dataset is heavily skewed but let's ignore that for now and just try to make accurate predictions for this dataset.
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Bias from algorithm

(Reminder: 20% of blue have $y=1$, 50% of green have $y=1$.)

A simple way to make relatively accurate predictions:
- for green individuals base the prediction on SAT
- for blue individuals ignore SAT score and always predict $y=0$

Result: up to 90% accuracy
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Bias from algorithm

- the dataset was already skewed but the algorithm's prediction are even more "unfair"
- this is because it's easier to just base the decision on race than to figure out the effect of the SAT
- this is an extreme case but similar things actually can happen
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Bias from algorithm

**What we don't want:** the algorithm "being lazy" in a subgroup

**What we want:** the algorithm should make equally good predictions for all subgroups

Criterion that enforces this: *Equality of Opportunity*
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Equality of Opportunity

$$
P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0, Y=1) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1, Y=1)
$$
$$
Y \in \{0,1\} \\
S \in \{0,1\}
$$
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
(discuss equality of opportunity)

(also mention Equalised Odds)
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Equalised Odds

$$
P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0, Y=y) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1, Y=y)
$$
$$
Y \in \{0,1\} \\
S \in \{0,1\}
$$

    ## Summary of Fairness Criteria

    - Demographic Parity
    - Equalised Odds
    - Equality of Opportunity
    - Calibration by Group
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
    ## Statistical Parity
    #### (**independence** based notion of fairness)

    $$
    P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1)
    $$
    $$
    Y \in \{0,1\} \\
    S \in \{0,1\}
    $$ 
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
    ## Equalised Odds 
    #### (**separation** based notion of fairness)

    $$
    P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0, Y=y) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1, Y=y)
    $$
    $$
    Y \in \{0,1\} \\
    S \in \{0,1\}
    $$ 
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
    ## Equalised Opportunity 

    #### (**separation** based notion of fairness)

    $$
    P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=0, Y=1) = P(\hat{Y}=1 | S=1, Y=1)
    $$
    $$
    Y \in \{0,1\} \\
    S \in \{0,1\}
    $$ 
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
    ## Calibration by Group 
    #### (**sufficiency** based notion of fairness)

    $$
    P(Y=1 | \hat{Y}=\hat{y}, S=s) = \hat{y}
    $$
    $$
    \hat{Y} \in \[0...1\] \\
    S \in \{0,1\}
    $$ 
  </textarea></section>
</section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
    Let's have all the fairness!
  
    If we are fair with regards to all notions of fair, then we're fair... right?
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
    Independence based fairness (i.e. Statistical Parity)

    $$
    \hat{Y} \perp S
    $$

    Separation based fairness (i.e. Equalized Odds/Opportunity)

    $$
    \hat{Y} \perp S | Y
    $$

    For both to hold, then either $S \perp Y$, our data is fair, or $\hat{Y} \perp Y$, we have a random predictor.

    Similarly, Sufficiency cannot hold with either notion of fairness.

  <h2>So which fairness criteria should we use?</h2>
  <p>Consider a university, and we are in charge of administration!</p>
  <p>We can only accept 50% of all applicants.</p>
  <p>1,000 applicants are female and 1,000 of applicants are male.</p>
  <p>We have been tasked with being fair with regard to <b>gender</b>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We have an acceptance criteria that is highly predictive of success.</p>
  <p>80% of those who meet the acceptance criteria will successfully graduate.</p>
  <p>Only 10% of those who don't meet the acceptance criteria will successfully graduate.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>As we're a good university we have a lot of applications from people who dopn't meet the acceptance criteria.</p>
  <p>60% of female applicants meet the acceptance criteria.</p>
  <p>40% of male applicants meet the acceptance criteria.</p>
  <p>Remember, we can only accept 50% of all applicants</p>

  <h2>Which fairness criteria whould we use?</h2>
  <p>There's no right answer, all the above are "fair". It's important to consult domain experts to find which is the best fit for each problem. There is no one-size fits all.</p>

## How to enforce fairness?

Fairness constraints can be added pre, during or post training.

Pre-training examples
- Zemel Fair Representations
- Beutel Adversarial Representation
- Quadrianto Fair Interpretable Representations
- Feldman
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
During Training
- Zafar's methods
- Zhang
- Kehrenberg Fair GP

Post Training
- Hardt Recalibrating
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
  Popular approach is to add produce a "fair" representation. Consider that we have 2 roles, a data vendor, who is charge of collecting the data and preparing it. Our other role is a data user, someone who will be making predictions based on our data. 

  The data vendor is concerned that the data user may be using their data to make unfair decisions. So the data vendor decides to learn a new, fair representation.
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
The state-of-the-art method a fair representation this is to use an *adversarial* network, using a "Gradient-Reversal Layer" from Ganin et al.

</textarea></section>

<section>
  <h3>Problems with doing this?</h3>
  <section><h4>Any Ideas?</h4></section>
<section>
  <h4>What does this representation mean?</h4>

  <p>The learned representation is uninterpretable by default. Recently Quadrianto et al constrained the representation to be in the same same as the input so that we could look at what changed</p>
  </section>
<section>
  <h4>What if the vendor data user decides to be fair as well?</h4>

  <p>Referred to as "fair pipelines". Work has only just begun exploring these. Current research shows that these don't work (at the moment!)</p>
